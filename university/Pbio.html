        <h2>biology bachelor's degree overview</h2>

        <p>Biology — the study of life and living organisms — is the perfect foundational degree for a 
            variety of careers. A degree in biology can prepare you for immediate employment in fields 
            like conservation or zoology. It also can set you on the right track for medical school or 
            other professional or graduate programs.</p>
        <p>The University of Toledo in Ohio is a large, comprehensive institution. Our College of 
            Natural Sciences and Mathematics offers several undergraduate biology programs to match 
            your goals and interests.</p>
        <p>Here’s a brief explanation of the options. </p>
